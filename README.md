# Dual N-Back game in Angular with NgRx

This game is modeled after [Brain Workshop - a Dual N-Back game](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/)

This purpose of this project is to learn and demonstrate how to use NgRx.

This app also uses SVG for the game board, demonstrating how to use Angular to manipulate SVG

_notes:_ 
* _game play really lacks atm since it's pure (pseudo) random and needs to be tuned_
* _plenty of work left to do before it's a usable game_
