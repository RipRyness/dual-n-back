# Dual N-Back game in Angular with NgRx

This game is modeled after [Brain Workshop - a Dual N-Back game](http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/)

This purpose of this project is to learn and demonstrate how to use NgRx.

This app also uses SVG for the game board, demonstrating how to use Angular to manipulate SVG
